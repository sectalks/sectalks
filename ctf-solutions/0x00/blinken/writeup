# Code

I make no representations as to your sanity after reading this code.

zomg.py - Stage 1: Calculates possible passwords for sum totals provided on the commandline. 
mods.py - Stage 1: Calculates valid characters for use in zomg.py
rotate.py - Stage 2: Rough code used to work out what was going on with the encryption scheme in stage 2
encode.py - Stage 2: Encodes an arbitrary string with the 5-ring substitution cipher used in stage 2

# Breaking the encryption (zomg.py)

This challenge starts by requiring you to break an insecure encryption algorithm implemented
in Javascript:

- The user is prompted for a username and a password
- The username is iterated over:
  - The ordinal value of each character is found and multiplied together to
    produce a key, we'll call it the user_product
  - The ordinal values of each character are summed to produce a key, the
    user_sum - user_sum += ord(username[i])
- The password is also iterated over to produce a passwd_product and
  passwd_sum, but for the passwd_sum the square of the ordinal value is
  used - passwd_sum += ord(passwd[i])*ord(passwd[i])

To break the encryption, you must find what username string(s) product the
provided user_sum and user_product values, and what passwords strings produce
the provided passwd_sum and passwd_product values. These are:

user_sum = 1537
user_prod = 1172188274400
passwd_sum = 393644
passwd_prod = 1842055687879732800

Considering the _sum values only, this is a problem in dynamic programming: it
can be expressed recursively as smaller subproblems. A recursive solution in
pseudocode for the username looks a bit like:

    function find_user(user_sum):
        if user_sum == 0:
            return [""]

        output = []
        for char in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":
            output += char + find_user(user_sum - ord(char))
        
        return output

and for the password:

    function find_passwd(passwd_sum):
        if passwd_sum == 0:
            return [""]

        output = []
        for char in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":
            output += char + find_passwd(passwd_sum - ord(char)*ord(char))
        
        return output

These functions have a high complexity - something like O(2^n), more
computationally expensive than a basic bruteforce technique. However, the
reason I expressed the problem this way is to make the subproblems overlap: if
you run find_user, log all the user_sum arguments and count the number of times
each value appears, you'll see that it's being called multiple times with the
same value:

  Count user_sum argument to find_user()
     23 75272
     23 76832
     23 78408
     23 80000
     23 81608
     23 83232
     23 84872
     23 86528
     23 88200
     23 89888
     ...

So, we can build a cache, storing all the possible strings for a given user_sum
value. 

    function find_user(user_sum):
        if user_sum == 0:
            return [""]

        if cache[user_sum]:
            return cache[user_sum]

        output = []
        for char in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":
            output += char + find_user(user_sum - ord(char))
        
        cache[user_sum] = output
        return output

Adding this cache speeds things up enormously - because the algorithm only hits
the bottom of the tree a few times before the higher branches are stored in the
cache. Later calls for these higher values don't have to explore right down to the
leaves in order to find a result, they just pull it from the cache and continue.

The complexity of the algorithm with cache is something like O(n^c), a huge
improvement on 2^n, and the program now finds the user string in < 60 seconds.
Unfortunately, the tradeoff for decreased computational complexity is a huge
increase in memory requirements for the cache - computing the password it
quickly consumed 32GB of RAM before being killed by the OS ;) 

So, we need to optimise further. The way I approached this is by using the
user_product and passwd_product values: if these are created by multiplying the
character ordinal values, then the character ordinal values must be factors of
these numbers. It's easy enough to write a script (mods.py) to compute which
letters are factors of 1172188274400 and 1842055687879732800, and after a
couple of seconds we get:

"acdhnuxy" for the username, and
"adglorvx" for the password

This reduces our alphabet (and so our cache memory requirements) substantially.
Subbing these into our functions:

    function find_user(user_sum):
        if user_sum == 0:
            return [""]

        if cache[user_sum]:
            return cache[user_sum]

        output = []
        for char in "acdhnuxy":
            output += char + find_user(user_sum - ord(char))
        
        cache[user_sum] = output
        return output

...gives us the result in about seven seconds:

patrick@ace:~/sec/00 [0]$ time ./zomg.py 1537 393644

A bit of trial and error reveals the correct combination of username and
password from the above.

# Stage two (rotate.py)

For the second bit you're given a URL with a mysterious string, which seems to
control access to the secret area:

    http://some-server/access.php?s=FQEPBRAcExcLHxMABhYSEBMFXUZEWAQAFUQNUwERR18DVUFNXVRdRRFbBAdCRAtWBREWCVEFSkFWHREAER0=

Requesting the page from the server results in a message similar to "You do not
have permission to access the secret area. You have *user* level access."

From inspection it seems like a fairly good guess that the argument in the URL
is base64 encoded, and it indeed decodes succesfully to 62 bytes. There's no
obvious text encoded in the bytes.  So, I proceeded by writing a script that: 

    - produced 62 sequences of 62 bytes, modifying each byte in the string in turn
    - re-encoded the strings back to 62 base64 URL arguments
    - called the web application with each of the modified base64-encoded strings
    - scraped the HTML result for the output string

From this is became clear that the last four bytes - 0x11 0x00 0x11 0x1d -
affected the text 'user' in the output string: when they were modified the
letters in 'user' changed. It seemed like a fair guess that if I changed this
to 'admin' or similar the system would let me though. 

Unfortunately, the last four bytes do not correspond directly to the string
'user' - there's a cipher being applied between the bytes in the URL and the
output string. We need to work out how this cipher works in order to pass the
right bytes in, to make the application display 'admin'.

I trimmed bytes from the end of the string until the application just displayed
"u". I then generated 40 URLs to sweep that last byte's value from 0 to 40 and
scraped the HTML output, which gave me the following sequence of characters,
one character per URL:

    defg`abclmnohijktuvwpqrs-}~ xyz{DEFG@ABC

The - character I use above corresponds to something like a NULL - if you
request that character you get a blank response from the application. Then I
fixed the first character, added another byte to the end of the base64 string,
and swept that 0-40. This produced a different sequence of characters:

    srqpwvut{zyx ~}-cba`gfedkjihonmlSRQPWVUT

I kept adding bytes to the end of the string and sweeping them though the
range, until eventually the pattern started repeating:

    tuvwpqrs-}~ xyz{defg`abclmnohijkTUVWPQRS
    onmlkjihgfedcba` ~}-{zyxwvutsrqpONMLKJIM
    a`cbedgfihkjmlonqpsrutwvyx{z}- ~A@CBEDGF
    defg`abclmnohijktuvwpqrs-}~ xyz{DEFG@ABC <-- repeat

So it's a substitution cipher with five alphabets: the alphabet used is
dependent on the position of the byte in the base64 string. 

Now I was able to encode arbitary strings and make the application display
them: just look up the position of the character you want in the relevant
alphabet string and that's the byte you need to encode. 

This resulted in encode.py, a script to encode arbitrary strings:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import sys

    strings = [
    "defg`abclmnohijktuvwpqrs-}~ xyz{DEFG@ABC", # Note it's possible these go for more than 40 characters, I stopped 
    "srqpwvut{zyx ~}-cba`gfedkjihonmlSRQPWVUT", # searching at that point
    "tuvwpqrs-}~ xyz{defg`abclmnohijkTUVWPQRS",
    "onmlkjihgfedcba` ~}-{zyxwvutsrqpONMLKJIM",
    "a`cbedgfihkjmlonqpsrutwvyx{z}- ~A@CBEDGF",
    ]

    inp = sys.argv[1]
    for i in range(len(inp)):
        u = strings[i % 5]
        print str(u.find(inp[i])) + ", ",

Running it as follows gives:

    patrick@ace:~/sec/00 [0]$ ./encode.py admin
    5,  23,  25,  6,  15,

which are the bytes to whack on the end of the URL to get "admin". This gets
you in to the secret area! \o/
