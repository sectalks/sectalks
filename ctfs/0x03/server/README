==Introduction==

A game-like application has been uncovered on a NSA server which you think is
being used to send secret information. Of course, you (and everyone else) wants
to find out if this is true. The system is located at http://54.84.254.198: see
what you can find.

==The actual README bit==

This is the game server for the CTF challenge described above, developed for
the Western Australian security group sectalks. 

The challenge was released on 28/02/2014, with hints (below) released on
27/03/2014 and solutions discussed the following month.

There are four flags:
 1. You must first notice some encrypted information leaking from the
    server, and brute-force this to obtain the key to login.
 2. Once in, you discover a MUD-style RPG. Exploring the world, there are some
    documents you cannot pick up, but "perhaps an admin can do this for you?"
 3. You guess that you must login with username admin. To do so, you must use SQL
	injection. Once you gt the documents, you must analyse the file downloaded by
	the client to obtain the third flag (an image)
 4. Finally, navigating the RPG you find a "radio" which spits an RTP header at
	you followed by a stream of bytes. From the header, you should deterine the
	encoding of the stream is G.711 ulaw. Decoding the stream takes you to a
	youtube URL for the final flag.

Challenges and solutions are available at https://github.com/nanomebia/sectalks.

The game server is written in Python; the client is written in VC++. All the 
nasty Python bugs in this repository are entirely blinken's fault ;)

==Hints==
As released to the mailing list:

	From: Patrick Coleman <blinken@gmail.com>
	Date: Thu, Mar 27, 2014 at 6:38 PM
	Subject: Challenge 0x03 hints
	To: sectalks@groupspaces.com

	I presented some hints on how to progress through the challenge at the talk
	tonight; for the benefit of those who weren't there, here's a summary :)

	There are four flags. Each has a rough theme. While using the client isn't
	necessary (you can telnet to 54.186.22.247 4445), it'll probably make life
	easier for you on flags #3 and #4.

	In terms of time - I'd expect #1 and #2 would be pretty achievable even if
	you're working (and so only get an hour or two a week to work on the
	challenge). #3 and #4 might require a bit more research and thinking.

	#1 - Crypto

	You're presented with a prompt for the "NSA TeLePrEsEnCe system", which you
	need to break in to. 

	When you fill in random details you get a message and an error:

	Username: blinken Password: asd cipherchange:cipher=arc4:keylen=6:charset=alpha
	<garbage>error::

	What the server is trying to tell you here is that the encryption used for
	communication with the client is changing from none to ARC4, with a key length
	of six alphabetic characters (lowercase). It's then sending you some characters
	(you can assume these are english words in printable ASCII) encrypted with the
	secret key, which are appearing as garbage on the console.

	The encryption key is sufficiently short and simple that you can bruteforce it
	using the encrypted characters provided and some scripting that guesses keys
	and checks the output for printable ASCII.

	Note at the NSA it was a recent (classified) policy decision that all passwords
	are set to the same secret value, which is also used as the secret key. This
	means you can enter any username you want: enter your handle so we can watch
	for you in the server logs.

	As far as ARC4 goes, if you're hardcore like matt you can write your own ARC4
	implementation. Otherwise, you can do what I did and import pycrypto :)

	#2 - Server vulnerabilities

	Once you crack flag #1, you'll be presented with an interactive environment (a
	game). You can play the game if you want (please do, it was a long night
	writing it ;), but it's not important to solve flag #2. 

	You're looking for the string "Perhaps an admin can do this for you." when you
	try to perform a certain action. This is a hint that you need administrative
	privileges to perform the action (and get the flag).

	Note that when you try to log in as username "admin" the response is different
	to other usernames - no garbage or cipherchange.

	Username: admin Password: asd error::

	This suggests that the 'admin' username is treated differently. The hint here
	is that the admin password is stored in a database. 

	Logging in is sufficient to get the flag. If you can work out what the admin
	password actually is (it should be possible, though not necessary and I haven't
	tried myself) I'll shout you a beer.

	#3 - File analysis

	Once you log in as admin, try to perform the action again that you were
	attempting for flag #2. You'll get a file dumped to your computer, plus a magic
	key which will permit you to progress to flag #4. 

	The file is an obfuscated archive containing an image. Work out the format and
	make it extract itself, then send us the image.

	#4 - Protocol analysis

	I got all carried away with writing the game server by this point, so you'll
	need to pick up the magic key found in flag #3 and play the game. There's only
	really one path anyway.

	You're looking for a radio. Once you find it, the server will stream (key word
	here is stream) bytes at you. 

	Decode these - the header contains hints as to the format - and follow the
	instructions contained within.

	--

	General hints: - None of this is particularly hard, though it might be a bit
	obscure. If you find yourself sending shellcode to the server or fighting with
	multithreading you're probably overthinking it - Let me know in IRC if you're
	stuck on something and I'll try and give you a hint; procedural issues aren't
	the aim of this

	We'll discuss solutions to whichever flags have have been cracked by a few
	people at the next sectalks.
